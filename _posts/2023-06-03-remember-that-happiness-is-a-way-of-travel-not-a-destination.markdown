> It is never too late to start

Couple of days ago I decided to launch a place where I can share my learning along the way I build products. 
Blog was first thing to choose. 
I decided to move along with Jakyll and Github Pages to host it. 
Blog posts are written in markdown everything has automated deployment process out of the box on github you just need
to commit to `gh-pages` branch and that's it. 
Worth noticing is that if you want to have your webiste at e.g. `<github-username>.github.io` you need to have repo named 
`<github-username>.github.io`
