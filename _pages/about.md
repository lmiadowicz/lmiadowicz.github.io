I am a versatile professional with a strong background in product management, data engineering, and business development. With over a decade of experience working in the tech industry, I have successfully contributed to the growth and success of various companies, including startups and top Forbes 500 organizations.

My journey began during my studies at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology, where I worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant in the field of quantum computing and quantum chemistry. This experience allowed me to develop expertise in programming scientific packages and laid the foundation for my future career in technology.

I started my professional career as a software engineer, working on projects related to augmented reality, marketing, and IoT solutions. I co-founded a company called ARound, where we developed computer vision-based systems for augmented reality and marketing, winning the prestigious INTEL prize for our NeurON system that combined AR with brainwave analysis.

From there, I transitioned to roles in data analysis and business development at Huuuge Games, a leading gaming company. I gained valuable insights into business intelligence and successfully managed the Huuuge Fund and Huuuge Publishing departments, contributing to the company's growth and expansion.

I later ventured into the field of product management, working as a senior product manager at STX Next, where I honed my skills in managing and delivering successful products. I also served as a senior technical product manager at AirHelp, where I focused on leveraging my technical expertise to drive product development.

In recent years, I have been involved in consulting top Forbes 500 companies on product management and data engineering in the context of AI implementations. I have worked with Qtravel.ai and Daugherty Business Solutions, providing strategic guidance and helping organizations harness the power of AI in their products and services.

Throughout my career, I have continually expanded my skill set, including completing the Deep Learning Nanodegree program offered by Udacity, where I developed proficiency in deep learning algorithms and technologies such as TensorFlow.

With my diverse background and expertise in product management, data engineering, and business development, I bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake. I am passionate about leveraging technology and data to drive innovation and create impactful solutions. I am always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to the growth and success of companies in the tech industry.
