I am a versatile professional with over a decade of experience in product management, data engineering, and business development. From my early days in quantum computing and quantum chemistry research to co-founding an augmented reality startup, I have gained diverse expertise.

I have worked at leading companies like Huuuge Games, STX Next, and AirHelp, where I excelled in roles ranging from software engineer to senior product manager. Consulting for top Forbes 500 companies on AI implementations has been a recent focus.

Continuously expanding my skill set, I completed the Deep Learning Nanodegree program, specializing in deep learning algorithms and technologies like TensorFlow.

With a passion for leveraging technology and data to drive innovation, I bring a unique perspective to every project. I am always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to the growth and success of tech companies.
